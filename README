# Grid20m

Separates and grids GBO's 20m data.

## Use
From a terminal:

   grid20m <input_filename> [-o <output_path>] [-a <channel_averaging_factor>] [--overwrite] [-v <verbosity level>] 

this will produce a series of cubes, as FITS files.
The number of cubes produced depends on how many 
polarizations and spectral windows are present in 
the input file.
